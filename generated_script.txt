...

buzz and the rc car drive straight into it.

scud blindly follows straight into the closet. he clears his
wrist communicator. he crumples it up and tosses it
aside.

woody picks up woody, examines him for a beat and then smiles.

woody
(to himself)
pull my string! the mystic
portal awaits!

woody
buzz!!

buzz

buzz!

woody leaps off the partition and tackles buzz towards the
hallway, getting buzz's helmet.

buzz
(checking his wrist communicator)
according to place!

woody leaps off the bed and hides behind buzz.

woody
(continued)
no, no one's not a dinosaur.

sid pulls out a magnifying glass from his back pocket and
focuses the beam to enter. welcome to
attack anger. they gotta be good
to sector 12?!
